# Algorithms in Computer Vision

The repository contains the implementation of various computer vision algorithms from scratch. 

## Introduction
This repository contains python implementation of the following algorithms from scratch. 


  i. CNN implementation using PyTorch. 
  
  ii. Classification of Cifar dataset using Alexnet pre-trained model. 
  
  iii. Segmentation using the following clustering algorithms: K-means, Seeding, mean-shift. 
  
  iv. Camera Clibration using OpenCV
  
  v. Implementation of Circular Hough Transformation 
  
  vi. Corner Detection 
  
  vii. Find matching regions in a image using SIFT features. 
  
  viii. Classification of CIFAR dataset using visual bag of words. 
  
  ix. Filtering algorithms: Gaussian, Median, etc. 
  
  x. Finding disparity maps using OpenCV
  
  xi. Image (hidden) Watermarking algorithm 
  
  xii. Image stitching to create a panorama. 
  
### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
